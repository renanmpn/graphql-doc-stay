# GraphQL Examples

This folder contains minimal, copy-pasteable GraphQL examples for your schema.

## Notes
- Pagination: use `pageInfo.endCursor` to fetch the next page.

## Files
- `queries/` – read operations (customers, subscriptions, merchant scope, forecast).
- `mutations/` – write operations (create subscription, swap line).
